# Summary

We develop and provide MetaSpread, an open source simulation framework and interactive program in Python, based on a mathematical model of tumor growth and metastatic spread, designed by [franssen2019]. This paper proposed a hybrid modeling and computational framework where cellular growth and metastatic spread are described and simulated in a spatially explicit manner, accounting for stochastic individual cell dynamics and deterministic dynamics of abiotic factors. This model incorporates several key processes such as the growth and movement of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, the role of the extracellular matrix, diffusion, haptotaxis, circulation and survival of cancer cells in the vasculature, and seeding and growth in secondary sites. In the software that we develop, these growth and metastatic dynamics are programmed using MESA, @[python-mesa-2020] a Python Package for Agent-based modeling.
