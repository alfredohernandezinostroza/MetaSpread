# MetaSpread: a cancer and metastasis simulation package

MetaSpread is a cancer and metastasis simulator written in Python, based on the work of Franssen et al [[1]](#1) and the MESA framework. With this package it is possible to simulate how cancer cells reproduce amd metastase to other parts of the body.

# Installing the package

MetaSpread it is readily available in the official PyPi repository. To install, simply run:

```
pip install metaspread

If you want to install manually, you can also download the source code as a zip file, unzip in an appropiate directory, and run

```
python -m metaspread
```
